mixcloud-track-graph-crawler
============================

ruby crawler which crawls through mixcloud trying to build a which-track-has-been-mixed-with-which-other-Tracks Graph

The Graph should be stored as RDF in a local-RDF-store. 
For this matter I arbitrarely chose 4store, as it was the first RDF-store my tired feet stumbled across during my long furays through the internet.

This is a project I do mainly for myself, 
to get familiar with basic semantic web-technologie and the mixcloud-api.
